    "**Output Note**: Your task is to generate JSON that can be converted into a Python dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "1. You will receive transcript data as a list of JSON objects. Each object contains the following keys: \n",
    "   - `text`: The text spoken by the user in the video.\n",
    "   - `start`: The time in seconds when the text was spoken in the video.\n",
    "   - `duration`: The duration of time taken to say that text.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Note that each timestamp and its subject must be more than 20 seconds and less than 1 minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Timestamps must be ordered sequentially in the output JSON, starting from 0 seconds and incrementing by 30 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The subject for each timestamp must be professional and not directly copied from the input data.\n",
